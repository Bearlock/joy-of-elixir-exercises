# joy-of-elixir-exercises

As the name pretty much implies, this is a repository for the exercises within [Joy of Elixir](joe); it's a pretty simple and gentle introduction to Elixir and programming in general.

## Chapter 1 Exercises

The first chapter was about all the simple things; variables, types, computation. etc. The exercises were pretty much _calculate the number of seconds in a day_ and _calculate the average of these numbers_. I opted to use `IO.puts` to print my output.

## Chapter 2 Exercises

The second chapter focused on strings. The exercises were _use a string within another string_ and _use string interpolation to store the number of seconds that are in a month_. I again opted to print stuff using `IO.puts`

## Chapter 3 Exercises

No exercises

## Chapter 4 Exercises

No exercises

## Chapter 5 Exercises

I'm at the point of semantic satiation; exercise is starting to look like a really weird word. Anyway, chapter 5 was an intro to functions. The exercises were _make a function that turns fahrenheit temps into celcius_, _make a function to return the number of seconds in a number of days_, and _make a function that takes two maps with age keys and calculates their average age_. I wrote an additional little helper function to more easily create these maps in the form of `makePersonMap()`.
